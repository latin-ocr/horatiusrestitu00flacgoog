naumurum nmsuausssou. xxxix

Non ut juvencis illigata pluribus
Aratra nitantur mela,

Pecusve Calabris ante sidus fervidum
Lucana mutet pascua;

Nec ut superni villa candens Tusculi
Circaea tangat moenia.

lt will hardly be believed, that instead of seeing in
these lines a disavowal of all wealth and splendor,
some critics have found in the two last the fancied
enlargement of a magnificent villa at Tusculum which
Horace already possessed there! Chonpp, Vol. 11.
pp. 262, 3. with great acuteness sets this matter in
it's true light.
’ Let us take another instance.
Horace· in a moody aud wayward humour, real or ·

affected, 1 E. v111. ceno gandera, &c instructs the
Muse thus to answe‘r if Celsus Albinovanus should

enquire about him:

—dic‚ multa et pulchra minantem,
Vivere nec r'ecte nec suaviter 3 haud quia grando
Contuderit uites, olcamoe momorderit aestus,
Nec quia longinquis armentum aegrotet in agris ,·
Sed quia mente minus validus, &c &c

T-hat is, denying olioe parda and oineynrds to be the
cause of his fretfulness he in fact-disclaims the owner-
ship of either: and he disclaims also any possession of
what even in the privileged hour of dedication he had
declined to ask from Apollo Palatinus·

Non astuosa grata Calabria·
, Arniento. 1 C. xxxi. 5, 6.
