HORACE.

...—--——.·

. HAvlrvc nov, for more than one third of a century,
been engaged in reading the works· of Horace with my
Pupils, and having long witnessed in his commenta-
tors the confusion very often attending their neglect
of his chronologus, (let me add of his bculitioe also),
Ι have been strongly inclined for some time past to
undertake the illustration of Horace, in that depart-
ment alone. By the light of Bentley’s discoveries in
his celebrated Prcefutio, the question De temporibus
librorum Horatii (though the rescit only of his in-
vestigatione without any part. of' the regular process
is given) Ι ventured to consider after all as in the
main decisively settled. And therefore if on the strength
of Bentleyls name Ι had proceeded to publish a new
edition of the works, without any other recommendation
than that of their being printed in the very order in
which they were originallypublished in successive books

by the author himself ;’ it struck· my mind very forcibly, .

that such an editions would be hailed by Scholars as

an era in Horatian literature.
