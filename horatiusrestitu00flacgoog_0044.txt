The fact is, that Sanadon saw⁴ nothing here beyond
the surface. Augustus, tribunus plebis, et plebi gratior
quum optimatibus, had been very dangerously ill in
Spain: that rumour of course plebem murima terruit:
the commone were trembling for the loss of their pro-
tector: the nobility caught at the chance of regaining
their old ascendancy in the state.

Or take it from the Argumentum of the Ode, as it
stands in Gesner’s edition. Bello Cantabrico maximus
erat uovorum tumultuum a partibus Optimuu'um metus,
ob diuturnam Augusti Tarracone decumbentis ualetudi-
uem. Illo 'igitur jam domum reverso, publicas ferias
Palatio universaeque PLEBI Horatius indicit.

Several conspiracies¹ formed against the life of that
Prinoe are recounted by Suetonius nr D Oct Oaes
Augusto, d XIX. But the most affert tmg story of the
kind rs that related by seneca, of Cinna’s desperate
design.. uou occidere, aed imumluue: uum sacrificantem
placuerat adarim. The recorded exclamation of Augus-
tus carries a point with it, which renders all comment
n'nnecessary.v Ego sum Nonrurnus adolescentibus eu'-
