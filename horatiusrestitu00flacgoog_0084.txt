Commonwealth, or from Mr Cramer’s Description of
Ancient Italy. ‘The most beautiful passage in that
poem shows how rapid and deep the growth of affection
had been betwixt Horace and his two friends, Virgil
and Varius: of Plotius we know little but by name.

·vv. 39-44. Postera lux oritur multo gratissima: namque

The vnth Satire, Proscripti Regis Rupili, &a might
be supposed (and not without some plausibility) to have
been Horace’s earliest attempt in Satiric writing. In
that view, Μ’ Sanadon speciously enough assigns for
its date a few months before the battle of Philippi,
and even discovers an argument in its juvenile careless-
ness of composition, to favour that date.

The old Scholiast, however, quoted by Baxter, ap-

satisfactory account of the matter.

Pubhus Rupilius cognomine Rex, Praenestinus, corn-
milito fuit Horatii in castris Bruti. Hic aegre ferens
quod Horatius Tribunus esset, saepe ignobilitatem ge·

neris illi objiciebat: idcirco nunc eum ex persona alterius
lacerat

This idea derives additional support and develope-
nent from two remarks of the judicious Gesner.

· Forte haec demum post victoriam Caesarianorum ,

scripta, curn partes Bruti objiceret Horatio recepto,
