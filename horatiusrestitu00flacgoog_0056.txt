w. 21-26. ——- fornix tibi et uncta popina

Incutiuut Urbis desiderium, video,· et quod

Nec vicina subest, vinum praebere taberna

ln consequence of this discovery, for in its application
l believe it so to be, we are enabled directly to mark
the scene of several of his writings as limited either
to Rome or to· Tivoli; and thus we distinguish, very
often, with little difficulty, what the great city allowed
him to write from what the vacuum Tibur suggested
or inspired.
· Loolr at the light and elegant ode to Phyllis. 40. xr.

vv. 2, 3. Est in horto, Ι Phylli, nectendis apium coronis, &a

But he hed no hortus at Rome3 as the same Epistle
testifies, ¹
rv. 41, Β. -——- invidet usum
Lignorum et pecoris tibi calo argutus et horti:
therefore this Ode >was not written in that city.¹
Horace goes on thus:

vv. 34, 5. ·—- condisce modos, amande} Voce quos reddas. ¹

But here is the meretrix tibicina, or a lady hardly of
purer quality: therefore it was not written in the valley.

of course Tivoli was ‚the scene of this gay celebra-
tion of Maecenas's birth-day. ’

(2.) Let us proceed to place in the true light that ·
beautiful Ode with its rational piety, · Ccelo supinus, dyc.
