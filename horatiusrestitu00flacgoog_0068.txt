Horace at the time of their migration, Ι thinlc could
hardly be less than tweloe years ⁴old. 'Phat age will
agree well enough with the term, mihi paruo, which
chronicles the stripes of Orbilius (aE.1-7o.): and
an earlier⁴ date, Ι sear, will hardly allow sufficient age

piched up by the buy Horace before quitting the neigh-
bourhood of Venusia. Ι speak advisedly, when Ι say,
that there appears no proof or vestigo of his ever
having lived in that country again: a hasty visit, per-
haps, in some year soon after the battle of Philippi,
seems the only feasible supposition, which his ‘own
history of his life and writings will possibly admit. ι

lowing instanoes are not¹ void of interest.
