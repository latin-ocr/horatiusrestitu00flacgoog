book of Horace, written in one common metre and
wonderfully agreeing in a well sustained high didactic
tone of moral, religione patriotic, sentiment, with that
striking prelude to the whole, Odi prrffooum volgae, dyc.
must impress on every sensible mind a deep feeling
of solemn grandeur, varied by amenity, and pathos, and
fine imagination.

If therefore any juxta-position of Odes preserved
in all MSS. and editions, might command reverence
horn* an editor of Horace3 Odes like these six could
not possibly suffer violation by being torn asunder.
Sanadon disjoins these six Alcaic Odes from one another
entirely, and has not left even any two of them in
any connection or contiguity whatsoever!

(4.) On minute examination it has been ascer-
tained, (vid. Classical Journal No. xxn. p. 352. J. T.)

that in the third line of the Alcaic Stante,

2Speeimens of this suncture, Hunc Lesbio Ι sacrare plectro.
with 3 of this --—, Regumque matres Ι barbarorum

and 8 of this ---, Pronos relabi Ι posse Ι rivos.

are contained in the first and second books of Odes;
while in the third and fourth books, as they commonly
stand, not one instance is now to be seen of a verse
ro construendis any of those ways.
